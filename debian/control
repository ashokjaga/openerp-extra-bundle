  * Two default payment types for partners (client and supplier).
  * Automatic selection of payment type in invoices. Now an invoice can have a payment term (30 days, 30/60 days, ...) and a payment type (cash, bank transfer, ...).
  * A default check field in partner bank accounts. The default partner bank accounts are selected in invoices and payments.
  * New menu/tree/forms to see payments to receive and payments to pay.
  * The payments show tree editable fields: Due date, bank account and a check field (for example to write down if a bank check in paper support has been received).
  * Two types of payment orders: Payable payment orders (from supplier invoices) and receivable payment orders (from client invoices). So we can make payment orders to receive the payments of our client invoices. Each payment order type has its own sequence.
  * The payment orders allow negative payment amounts. So we can have payment orders for supplier invoices (pay money) and refund supplier invoices (return or receive money). Or for client invoices (receive money) and refund client invoices (return or pay money).
  * Payment orders: Selected invoices are filtered by payment type, the second message communication can be set at the same time for several invoices.

  * placeholders for custom in and out mapping for OpenERP object fields.

  OpenERP already has limited supported to external ids using the ir_model_data and the id
  fields in the loaded data such as XML or CSV. We think that's OK to store all referential ids
  into the same ir_model_data table: yes it makes it large, but synchronisation operations involve
  a network bottleneck anyway, so it's largely OK and negligible to have a large table here.
  The existing ir_model_data feature of OpenERP is mostly thought as an mono-external referential
  (even if the module key of ir_model_data plays some referential scoping role). Here we just push
  the concept further to assume multiple external ids for OpenERP entities and add the possibility
  to customize their field mapping directly in OpenERP to accomodate the external systems.

Description: OpenERP module: fleet_maintenance
  Manage the maintenance contracts of a product fleet (streaming servers originally).
  .
  Now partners have fleets and sub-fleets for which they can buy products that can eventually
  be covered by paid maintenance contracts.
  .
  Fleet: a stock.location for which all products have the same maintenance end date anniversary.
  Indeed, it's useful to have several maintenance contracts for a given partner with a single anniversary date
  for an eventual renewal.
  Meaning that if the customer wants a different end date anniversaries for two maintenance contracts,
  then he should have several Fleets.
  Products don't go in the Fleets actually, they go in their Sub-Fleets instead.
  .
  Sub-Fleet: a stock.location child of a Fleet which might contains some purchased products.
  In a sub-fleet, ALL the maintenance contracts of the products have exactly the same start date and end date.
  Meaning that if a customer need several different start date or some years offset for the end date,
  then he should have several Sub-Fleets.
  .
  This module also take care of proposing ideal maintenance dates given a few rules that might
  be changed in your specific case (Ideally they wouldn't be hardcoded or at least have some
  parameters externalized to the database).
  .
  Finally, this module also takes care of after sale incidents, extending the native CRM and thus
  preserving all the CRM power.
  Given a product serial number (prodlot), it's able to retrieve the Fleet and Partner and know if a product is still covered
  by a maintenance contract or not. It also deals with reparation movements in a simple manner, that
  might later on made compatible with the mrp_repair module which was too complex for our first use here.
  .
  This module is also fully compliant with the native prodlot tracking of OpenERP to knwo
  where is a serial number, be it a finished product or only a part, and even after a replacement
  if movements are properly entered in the crm incident. For a better tracking experience, it's
  advised to use it along with the mrp_prodlot_autosplit module.

  ${misc:Depends}
Description: OpenERP module: l10n_fr_rib
  This module lets users enter the banking details of Partners in the RIB format (French standard for bank accounts details).
  RIB Bank Accounts can be entered in the "Accounting" tab of the Partner form by specifying the account type "RIB". The four standard RIB fields will then become mandatory:
  - Bank Code
  - Office Code
  - Account number
  - RIB key
  As a safety measure, OpenERP will check the RIB key whenever a RIB is saved, and will refuse to record the data if the key is incorrect. Please bear in mind that this can only happen when the user presses the "save" button, for example on the Partner Form.
  Since each bank account may relate to a Bank, users may enter the RIB Bank Code in the Bank form - it will the pre-fill the Bank Code on the RIB when they select the Bank.
  To make this easier, this module will also let users find Banks using their RIB code.
  .
  The module base_iban can be a useful addition to this module, because French banks are now progressively adopting the international IBAN format instead of the RIB format.
  The RIB and IBAN codes for a single account can be entered by recording two Bank Accounts in OpenERP: the first with the type "RIB", the second with the type "IBAN".
  .
  This module is a rewrite of the module "base_rib" from the community branch of OpenERP v5.0.
  It will be part of the main addons starting with OpenERP v6.1.

Description: OpenERP module: product_variant_multi
  OpenERP is already supporting a product variants at the core level. But
  without this module, variants are only mono-axial. OpenERP indeed uses the product.tempate
  as the model object and the product.variant as the instance variant.
  Using this module, you can now easily deal with multi-axial variants.
  A product.template, now has a set of dimensions (like Color, Size, anything you want).
  For each dimension, a product.template has a set of dimension values (like Red, Green
  for the Color dimension). For each dimension, you can accept or not custom dimension
  values. The sale interface product configurator will take it into account.
  Once the product.template is set up, you can use a 'generator' button that will populate
  the space of the variants. You could also choose to populate only some combinations
  by hand instead.
  Each variant can have an extra price that will be taken into account when computing
  the base listed price. Yet to be implemented: a price extra per variant dimension value.
  Finally, this module is better used along with the product_variant_configurator which
  will help the salesman selecting the appropriate variant in the sale order line
  using dimension criteria instead of having to crawl the full space of variants.

Description: OpenERP module: profiler
  OpenObject service and ORM profiler.
  .
  'A profiler is a program that describes the run time performance of a program
  providing a variety of statistics' - (James Roskind, Python Docs)
  .
  The OpenObject Profiler is a special module that tracks the execution of
  the OpenObject server, and outputs several kinds of stats like:
  * Number of service level calls (from an OpenObject client) and time spent.
  * ORM methods called by the service layer (times, sources of calls...).
  * Complexity info for service and ORM methods (time by number of records
  processed).
  * Browse records usage on the service methods (and leakage info).
  .
  A text output file will be created with a summary of the logged data after
  each service level call (after each client operation). The file name can be
  configured by setting the 'profiler_output' option on the OpenObject server
  configuration file.
  .
  Warning: This module shouldn't be installed on a production database!
  It's a tool made by developers for developers and developers only!
  .
  .
  .
  This is a sample of the output of the profiler:

Description: OpenERP module: project_mrp_extension
  This module extends project_mrp that creates a link between procurement orders
  containing "service" lines and project management tasks by adding the possibility
  to create also new project from Sale Order.
  .
  The base module (project_mrp) will automatically create a new task
  for each procurement order line, when the corresponding product
  meets the following characteristics:
  * Type = Service
  * Procurement method (Order fulfillment) = MTO (make to order)
  * Supply/Procurement method = Produce
  .
  With this extension, you'll be able to :
  .
  * Add tasks on existing project if "Project" field is fullfilled on the
  Product of the SO line.
  .
  * Add tasks on existing an project if "Analytic Account" field is fullfilled
  on the Sale Order.
  .
  In those cases, the procurement is always related to the
  task. When the project task is completed or cancelled, the workflow of the
  corresponding procurement line is updated accordingly.
  Note that Project set in Product overwrite the Analytic Account set in the
  order as it was done in project_mrp.
  .
  * Create a new project if you let the "Analytic Account" field empty on the
  Sale Order. In that case, the procurement line is linked to the project and
  will be completed when the project will be done (closed). The project will
  be created from all Sale Order Line of type service and one task per line will
  be associated to it.

  - Import accounts from CSV files. This may be useful to import the initial
  accounts into OpenERP.
  .
  - Import account moves from CSV files. This may be useful to import the initial
  balance into OpenERP.
  .
  .
  Check and Repair tools:
  .
  - Check the Chart of Accounts for problems in its structure. This will allow
  you to detect incoherences like the ones caused by bugs like
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject-server/+bug/581137
  (the preordered tree [parent_left/parent_right] not matching the
  parent-child structure [parent_id]).
  .
  - Revalidate confirmed account moves so their analytic lines are regenerated.
  This may be used to fix the data after bugs like
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject-addons/+bug/582988
  The wizard also lets you find account moves missing their analytic lines.
  .
  - Set the receivable/payable account of the partners, in moves and invoices
  where a generic receivable/payable account was used instead.
  .
  - Set the parent reference in account move lines where the receivable/payable
  account associated with the partner was used, but a partner reference wasn't
  set. This may fix cases where the receivable/payable amounts displayed in the
  partner form does not match the balance of the receivable/payable accounts.
  .
  - Set the reference in account moves, associated with invoices, that do not have
  the right reference (the reference from the invoice if it was a supplier
  invoice, or the number from the invoice if it was a customer invoice).
  This is useful to fix the account moves after changing the invoice references.

  If you are not in the 'dev' environment you will not be able to see the values containing 'passw' in key.
  .
  At the current time, the module does not allow to set low level attributes such as database server, etc. .
  .
  The first goal of the module is to ensure that OpenERP will never mess up the external system.
  Once installed, profile is mandatory. We do not want to launch an instance in the dev environment on a production server.
  .
  .
  .
  The configuration files are to put in the module server_environment_files ; they are using the config parser module syntax.
  Look at the module to get some sexamples.
  The default configuration are to put in the default folder. All config defined in other environment will be overwritten or added to default one.
  Then, you can add a folder by used  environment with the name of the environment
  If your attibutes contain passw it will only be shown in dev environment.
  .
  Usage samples:
  .
  from server_environment import serv_config
  for key, value in serv_config.items('external_service.ftp'):
  print (key, value)
  .
  .
  serv_config.get('external_service.ftp', 'tls')

  Not a daily best practise, but certainly useful to deal with historical data, such as orders imported from ecommerce for instance.

Description: OpenERP module: stock_extension
  Several improvements for stock module:
  .
  * stock_picking
  - Add 'To Invoice' filter button to the 'Picking In' search view.
  - Remove readonly attribute of the invoice_state field to allow to invoice any stock picking (for example, if someone deletes by mistake the invoice of invoiced picking).
  - Fix bug when the Process Picking Wizard is cancelled: Clears the buffer to prevent that previous lines of picking are added to the current wizard.
  - When the invoice lines are created from an IN picking, the price unit of the picking is added instead of the cost price of the product.
  - Changing the average price of a product: If valuation == 'manual_periodic' is not necessary create an account move for stock variation.
  - Change stock.picking order from newest to oldest.
  - Add the client_order_ref field to the stock.picking model.
  - Makes visible the 'name' field in stock.picking views.

  Idea
  ####
  .
  The idea for this module is to set stock quantities only for products listed in
  this inventory and only for locations which are defined in this inventory. All
  other stock quantities will be set to 0 for every products and every locations
  not listed in this inventory.
  .
  .
  Products not listed in the inventory
  ####################################
  .
  Products not listed in the inventory have their stock quantities set to 0 to
  all their locations.
  .
  .
  Locations not listed in the inventory
  #####################################
  .
  For products listed in the inventory, stock quantities are set to 0 to all
  their locations not listed.
  .
  .
  Inventory line quantity defaults to 1
  #####################################
  .
  The default quantity for a line in the original *stock* module is equal to the
  stock value for the location specified in this line.
  .
  This module sets the default quantity to just 1. This way is more compatible
  with barcode scanners where you scan products one by one.

  new_average_price = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  current_stock - picking_qty + invoice_qty
